Welcome to CS 106B/X Trailblazer!
This program searches for paths through graphs
representing maps, mazes, and rocky terrains.
It demonstrates several graph algorithms for
finding paths, such as depth-first search (DFS),
breadth-first search (BFS), Dijkstra's Algorithm,
and A* search. You can also generate random mazes
using Kruskal's algorithm.
